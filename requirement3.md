LMM

As mention in the other requirement and requirement2 this programe is to be use by my student on their computeur with minimal installation. This program is to give to the student (most of them do not have the required statistical level to do Linear mixed model on their own). So I would like a GUI that will open a browser to open an excel file. This is the excel file that is created by the other program called csv_data_extractor.py in this same project. So the data are stuctured like this, column 1 is the file name, then many colum with different informations like YYYY, MM, DD, etc. there will be a column for the animal ID number, a colum for the type of test, a column for male or female, their PCA results, their weight, and even some notes, more importantly there will be some colum for example with the substance the animal receive or the group the animal belong to. So those column can be the independent variables. Then there will be bunch of dependent variables extracted by the csv_data_extractor.py that produce pairs of column one indicate the number of a particular marker and the second is the averaged time the marker taking to apear in the trials. Then it could have 10 to 15 differents markers.

The LMM. Most of our data are repeated mesures so it is important to take the animal ID to be sure we are taking this into the LMM. Sometime iti is important to have the temporal serie in right order so if there is not yet a relative day for each animal you may add a column for this. So, the GUI will have a dropdown to indicate which column is the animal unique ID. Then 3 dropdown to select the VI, if only one or 2 selected it is ok too. Then, 6 dropdowns for the VD. A button 'analyse this'. then it will use the column names to help to see which analysis is which. You will produce a QQplot for each VD with underneet a pass, fail, weak. to indicate if the QQ are indicating that it is ok to continue whith this analysis. Or we can even have the  dropdown on top of the QQplot. Then you give the usual LMM results under the QQplot and in red what is statisticaly signifiant and put the graphs.
