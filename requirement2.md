This program in python will run with a minimal installation and dependencies for the sudent can use it on their own computers.


The program will start with a simple GUI with a browser button to select a folder. Once the folder is selected (and you can give an error if the student select a file instead of the folder). Then it will take all the files names .csv and put them in the first column of an excel file that will be created and save in the same folder as the files that it took their name. 

The name of the .csv file are allways the same YYYY_MM_DD__hh_mm_ss_3 or 4 digits animal number.csv. So you can extract for column 2 the year, 3 the date, etc. If there is animal number with more that 4 digit or with letter they can be left out.
